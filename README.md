# 🎨 Multi-Theme Switcher App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to switch between three distinct UI themes. Each theme changes not only the colors but also the font styles, layout structure, spacing, and overall component design — without relying on external UI libraries like DaisyUI, Material UI, or Ant Design.

## 🚀 Features
